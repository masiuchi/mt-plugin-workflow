    <p>Workflow steps are defined on a per-blog basis right now.  To see the list, open up the 'Manage' menu and select 'Workflow.'  New steps are always created at the end of the workflow.  Steps can be associated with roles or authors.  When transferring an object to the next step, a new owner will be chosen by selecting the user (from the list of users associated with the next step) whose most recent workflow status change is oldest (i.e. one who hasn't made any changes in the longest time).</p>
